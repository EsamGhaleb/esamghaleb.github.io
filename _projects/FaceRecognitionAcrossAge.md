This is an example of my early academic work experiences. In this project, I studied the aging effect on face recognition utilizing Harry Potter movies for my Master of Science degree in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). In this research direction, my worked focused on contributing to the state-of-the-art in face recognition when data is measured in the wild under challenging conditions. The work was carried out under the supervision of [Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/) and [Prof. Dr. Hazim Kemal Ekenel](https://web.itu.edu.tr/ekenel/index.html) and published in the *ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval:*
