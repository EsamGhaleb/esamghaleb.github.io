This is an example of my early academic work experiences. In this project, I studied the aging effect on face recognition utilizing Harry Potter movies for my Master of Science degree in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). In this research direction, my worked focused on contributing to the state-of-the-art in face recognition when data is measured in the wild under challenging conditions. The work was carried out under the supervision of [Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/) and [Prof. Dr. Hazim Kemal Ekenel](https://web.itu.edu.tr/ekenel/index.html). This work was funded by the German Research Foundation under contract no. STI-598/2-1; TUBITAK within the CHIST-ERA project titled [CAMOMILE](https://www.chistera.eu/projects/camomile), project no. 112E176; and a Marie Curie FP7 Integration Grant in the 7th EU Framework.
