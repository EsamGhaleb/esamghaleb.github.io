During my Ph.D., I worked for the Horizon 2020-funded project [MaTHiSiS](http://mathisis-project.eu/) , which is an educational platform that provides a personalized learning experience based on multimodal emotion recognition from diverse cues. In MaTHiSiS, my research exploited a wide range of sensors to capture the affective states of the learners. Subsequently, the project aimed to foster a personalized experience for students by increasing their engagement and preventing boredom and anxiety. My research at MaTHiSiS benefited from pedagogical experts to develop dynamic multimodal fusion based on different learners' use cases, such as learners with an autism spectrum disorder or severe disabilities.
