The [MaTHiSiS](http://mathisis-project.eu/) learning vision is to provide a product system for vocational training and mainstream education for both individuals with an intellectual disability and non-diagnosed ones. This product system consists of an integrated anthropocentric platform, along with a set of learning components (educational material, digital educational artifacts etc.), which will respond to the needs of a future educational framework and provide capabilities for: i) adaptive learning, ii) automatic feedback, iii) automatic assessment of learner’s progress and behavioral state, iv) game-based learning. MaTHiSiS will make use of cutting-edge technologies in learning settings that range from specialized robots and mobile devices to interactive whiteboards and will advance them to a greater degree of integration into the market. MaTHiSiS will create a novel and continuously adaptable “robot/machine/computer”-human interaction educational scheme which adapts to different learning requirements and makes use of the shared knowledge among its different components to advance learning beyond linear social skill acquisition towards more workplace-oriented activities.

The MaTHiSiS consortium is coordinated by Atos Spain and consists of 18 beneficiary organizations from 9 different Member States collaborating, namely Spain, France, Greece, UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Lithuania and Germany.
