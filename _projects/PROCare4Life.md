Beside my research work as postdoctoral researcher at Maastricht University, I also work for the H2020 European project, [PROCareLife](https://procare4life.eu/). PROCare4Life is an e-health care platform that aims to provide an integrated e-health care monitoring system for seniors with neurodegenerative diseases. In PROCare4Life, my research aims to develop a personalized and dynamic multimodal fusion of behaviors based on data collected from patient symptoms, activities, cognitive abilities, and health records. The multimodal fusion integrates domain knowledge of socio-health professionals into Bayesian Networks, to develop a personalized decision support system, improving patients’ quality of life by detecting deviations in their routines and health conditions.
