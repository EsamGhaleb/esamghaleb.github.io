The main contribution of [PROCareLife](https://procare4life.eu/) consists in proposing an integrated scalable and interactive care ecosystem, which can be easily adapted to the reality of several chronic diseases, care institutions and end-user requirements, benefiting all the involved actors, from patients, to caregivers and health professionals. Its main contributions consist of: (a) building an integrated scalable and interactive care ecosystem for neurodegenerative diseases and adaptable to other chronic conditions; (b) finding the best actions/measures from a medical and social point of view that can facilitate an improved quality of life, awareness and care management for senior users suffering of neurodegenerative and/or other chronic diseases; (c) provide a personalized recommendation and interaction model, which can support the user through gamification techniques to adopt healthy habits, maintain a good daily routine and follow the prescribed actions by the professionals for maintaining and improving their health condition; (d) enable multi-disciplinary communication between all involved stakeholders, better time management for social and health professionals and contribute to achieving a cost-efficient, flexible and high adaptable solution for senior users suffering of short or long term conditions.
