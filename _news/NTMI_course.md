I am grateful to have had the opportunity to contribute as a course co-coordinator and co-lecturer for the "[Natuurlijke Taalmodellen en Interfaces (NTMI)](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2022-2023/zoek-vak/vak/98500) - Natural Language Models and Interfaces" module in the Kunstmatige intelligentie (AI) Bachelor's program at the University of Amsterdam. I had the pleasure of working and collaborating with Dr. Wilker Aziz, who has been teaching this course for several years at UvA. Together, we offered students insight into AI techniques and applications in natural language processing. I thoroughly enjoyed this rewarding experience!
