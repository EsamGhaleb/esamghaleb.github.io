Our paper "Learning Co-Speech Gesture Representations in Dialogue through Contrastive Learning: An Intrinsic Evaluation" was accepted at [26th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction 2024](https://icmi.acm.org/2024/). Our work presents a novel approach to learning co-speech gesture representations in dialogue through contrastive learning. We evaluate the learned representations through intrinsic evaluations by comparison with human-annotated pair-wise gesture similarity. Stay tuned for the camera-ready version.
