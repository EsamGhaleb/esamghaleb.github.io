We are thrilled to announce that two of our papers have been accepted at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025):

- Our paper on titled "I see what you mean: Co-Speech Gestures for Reference Resolution in Multimodal Dialogue" has been accepted at ACL Findings 2025! This work explores the role of co-speech gestures in resolving references in multimodal dialogue, contributing to the understanding of how gestures can enhance communication and comprehension in human interactions.

- The second paper, titled "LLMs instead of human judges? A large scale empirical study across 20 NLP evaluation tasks", has been accepted at ACL 2025. This paper investigates the effectiveness and drawbacks of large language models (LLMs) as substitutes for human judges in evaluating NLP tasks. It provides results for and insights into the potential of LLMs in automated evaluation processes.
