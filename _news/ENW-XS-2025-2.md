I am Happy to share that my project "Grounded Gesture Generation in Context: Object- and Interaction-Aware Generative AI Models of Language Use" has been awarded an NWO XS Open Competition - Domain Science grant ðŸ¥³

This project aims to develop generative AI models that can produce grounded gestures in context, focusing on object and interaction awareness. The research will explore how these models can enhance human-computer interaction and improve the understanding of multimodal communication.

For more details about the project, please refer to the [MPI for Psycholinguistics press release:  Esam Ghaleb receives grant to develop gesture and interaction-aware multimodal generative AI](https://www.mpi.nl/news/esam-ghaleb-receives-grant-develop-gesture-and-interaction-aware-multimodal-generative-ai).
