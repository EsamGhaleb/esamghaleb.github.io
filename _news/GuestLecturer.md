I am excited to be a guest lecturer on machine learning for multimodal behavior in the summer school “[Practical Approaches to Human Multimodal Behavior: From Acquiring and Aligning Data to Quantifying Patterns](https://envisionbox.org/summerschool.html).” The program aims to offer in-depth insights into applying quantitative and mixed methods tools for multimodal analyses of human behaviors.
