I am excited to be a guest lecturer on machine learning for multimodal communication in the summer school “[Practical Approaches to Human Multimodal Behavior: From Acquiring and Aligning Data to Quantifying Patterns](https://vicom.info/summer-school-practical-approaches-to-human-multimodal-behavior-from-acquiring-and-aligning-data-to-quantifying-patterns/).” The program aims to offer in-depth insights into applying quantitative and mixed methods tools for multimodal analyses of human behaviors.
