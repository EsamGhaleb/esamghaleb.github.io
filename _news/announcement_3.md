Paper accepted at [FG2021](http://iab-rubric.org/fg2021/)!  Our paper titled "Skeleton-Based Explainable Bodily Expressed Emotion RecognitionThrough Graph Convolutional Networks" was accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture RecognitionOur work entitled ". Our research aimed at presenting an explainable and interpretable approach for bodily expressed emotion recognition. It utilizes the body joints of the human skeleton, representing them as a graph, which is used in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).
