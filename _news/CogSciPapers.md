Two papers have been accepted at [CogSci24](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci-2024/). Stay tuned for the camera-ready versions. One paper focuses on detecting and analyzing alignment through shared expressions, while the other explores how speakers align through shared expressions and gestures (with [Sho Akamine](https://www.mpi.nl/people/akamine-sho)).
