I had the privilege of giving a plenary lecture and two hands-on workshop labs on multimodal interaction together with Raquel FernÃ¡ndez at the MEDAL Summer School in Computational Modelling (University of Birmingham). Our lecture focused on recent work with collaborators on learning and evaluating gesture representations:

- ðŸ“„ [Learning Co-Speech Gesture Representations in Dialogue through Contrastive Learning: An Intrinsic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00071) (ICMI 2024).

- ðŸ“„ [I see what you mean: Co-Speech Gestures for Reference Resolution in Multimodal Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00071) (Findings of ACL 2025).



For those interested, all workshop materials (code, data, and step-by-step notebooks) are openly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EsamGhaleb/medal_workshop_on_multimodal_interaction).

Many thanks to the MEDAL team for the invitation and to all participants for the inspiring and stimulating conversations.
