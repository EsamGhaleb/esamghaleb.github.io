  -  Broadly, my research is focused on Human-centered AI, specifically on affective computing, eXplainable AI (XAI), and understanding human behaviors & communication. I utilize various behavioral & communication cues such as facial expressions, voice prosody, bodily movements, speech, and gestures to develop transparent and explainable methodologies that improve people's lives through insights into human behaviors from domain knowledge.
