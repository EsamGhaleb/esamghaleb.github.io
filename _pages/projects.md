**Research scope and interests**:

**Multimodal face-to-face dialogue modeling.** I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Dialogue Modelling Group at the Institute for Logic, Language & Computation (ILLC), University of Amsterdam. My primary research focuses on face-to-face dialogue modeling. Specifically, I am interested in dialogue coordination to model and understand the emergence and maintenance of cross-modal convergence in dialogue when interlocutors speak about novel objects. In this work, I collaborate with lead linguists and cognitive scientists specializing in dialogue and gestures from UvA, Radboud University, and TU Dresden.

**Multimodal emotion recognition.** My previous research experiences have focused on modeling and recognizing human behaviors and communication through multiple cues, including speech, gestures, facial expressions, and body postures. During my Ph.D. at Maastricht University, I researched multimodal emotion recognition using visual and auditory cues. In my doctoral research, I developed novel computational methodologies to capture bimodal cues' complementary information for emotion recognition. I also worked on the Horizon 2020 project, MaTHiSiS, developing multimodal fusion methods for emotion recognition in an e-learning platform.

**Explainable AI for emotion and behavior recognition.** In my postdoctoral research at UM, my work extended beyond conventional explainable AI on audio-video as expressive modalities, redirecting the fieldâ€™s attention toward gestural expressions for emotion recognition. In addition,  I worked on multimodal human behavioral analysis for people with neurodegenerative diseases in the Horizon 2020 EU project, ProCare4Life. This project aimed to detect abnormalities in their symptoms and activities. I collaborated with socio-health professionals to develop a decision support system based on state-of-the-art computational models, demonstrating the benefits of complementing machine intelligence with human expertise using hybrid AI.
