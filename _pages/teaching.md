### Teaching

My teaching goals revolve around fostering students’ knowledge, interests, and personal growth to prepare them for future challenges in the field of AI. In teaching, I am interested in supporting students’ critical thinking and collaboration in real-world problems to deepen their theoretical and practical understanding of learning materials. I pay significant attention to motivating students to participate and engage interactively during lectures.

During my studies and work experiences, I was lucky to gain teaching experiences across different cultures, disciplines, and institutes.

* **2023 – Kunstmatige intelligentie – Bachelor (Bachelor of AI), University of Amsterdam**
  * Course co-coordinator and lecturer of [Natuurlijke Taalmodellen en Interfaces (NTMI) - Natural Language Models and Interfaces](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2022-2023/zoek-vak/vak/98500)
* **2022 – BSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, Department of Advanced Computing Sciences(DACS), Maastricht University**
  * Tutor in [DACS’s Research Project MAI 2](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/meta/438103/research-project-mai-2) in 2022
  * In this project course, I had regular weekly meetings with students to help them manage the workload and group dynamics and simulate self-learning to deliver the final project.
* **2017 - 2020 – MSc Artificial Intelligence, Department of Advanced Computing Sciences (DACS), Maastricht University**
  * Graduate TA of [Computer Vision (KEN4255)](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/meta/437213/computer-vision) in Period 5.
  * In this course, I was responsible for co-designing project homework and guiding more than 50 participating students through the computer vision course as a head teaching assistant at UM for four years in the AI master program. I also gave recitation tutorials and answered students’ questions about the course materials.
* **2016 - University College Maastricht (UCM), Maastricht University**
  * Undergraduate TA. [Programming (PRA2003)](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/meta/435647/programming?print=1).. Period 4, 2016.
* **2015 – MSc Computer Engineering, Istanbul Technical University**
  * TA in [Content-based Image and Video Retrieval (BLG 544E)](https://ninova.itu.edu.tr/en/courses/institute-of-science-and-technology/2357/blg-544e/)

### Supervision Experiences

During my academic work, I have supervised Master's students and a Ph.D. candidate for their theses. I have supervised students’ research projects regularly and enthusiastically on diverse topics such as emotion recognition, XAI, and self-supervised learning, resulting in publications at prominent venues.

* **MSc Students (daily supervisor)**
  * **2021 - Andre Mertens**: [Explainable and Interpretable Features of Emotion in Human Body Expression](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TqP9GTsAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=TqP9GTsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC)
  * **2020 - Jan Lucas**: [Deep, Dimensional, and Multimodal Emotion Recognition Using Attention Mechanisms](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TqP9GTsAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=TqP9GTsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC)
* **Ph.D. candidates (daily supervisor)**
  * **2020-2021 - Bulat Khaertdinov**. With Bulat, we published several papers on Self-supervised learning for human activity recognition.
