**In brief**: I study and model how verbal and non-verbal cues work together in a variety of human behaviors. Since September 2024 I have been a researcher in the [Multimodal Language Department](https://www.mpi.nl/department/multimodal-language-department/23) at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, where I model multimodal communication for both human insight and machine applications.

Trained in computer science and engineering, I work across AI, cognitive science, psycholinguistics, psychology and healthcare to computationally model human behaviour for both fundamental and applied research. My work focuses on multimodal interaction, particularly in the context of dialogue. My research spans various domains, including gesture generation, multimodal dialogue systems, and previously affective computing, with applications in healthcare, human-computer interaction, and social robotics.

During my PhD and post-doc at Maastricht University, I developed explainable multimodal emotion-recognition techniques; at the Institute for Logic, Language & Computation (University of Amsterdam) I investigated linguistic–gestural alignment and automatic gesture segmentation in dialogues. My applied projects include two EU-funded studies (200+ participants) and a work package that combined clinicians’ expertise with machine intelligence for socio-economic contexts. 

<!-- Born in Yemen, I ranked in the top 0.2 % of high-school graduates, then earned BSc and MSc degrees (with honours) in computer engineering at Istanbul Technical University, including an internship at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. An early open-access dataset on age-invariant face recognition launched my interest in multimodal behaviour. -->
