Esam Ghaleb is a postdoctoral researcher in the [Dialogue Modelling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/) at the Institute for Logic, Language & Computation (ILLC), University of Amsterdam. Currently, he is working on modeling face-to-face dialogue using NLP, computer vision, and machine learning. His work is embedded within the [Language in Interaction](https://www.languageininteraction.nl/) consortium.

Previously, Ghaleb was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences at Maastricht University, working on the Horizon 2020 project, [ProCare4Life](https://procare4life.eu/). In the ProCare4Life project, his research focused on human behavioral analysis, mainly for people with neurodegenerative diseases. During his postdoctoral research, he worked on XAI for bodily expressed emotion recognition as well. Previously, Ghaleb completed his doctoral research at Maastricht University. During his Ph.D., he carried out research on bimodal emotion recognition through audio-visual cues. His work utilized facial expressions and speech signals in video clips and proposed progressive computational methodologies to capture their complementary information for emotion recognition. Ghaleb’s Ph.D. research was supported by the Horizon 2020 project [MaTHiSiS](http://mathisis-project.eu/). Besides his research and project work, he was a teaching assistant for the computer vision course at DACS at Maastricht University.

Before joining UM, Ghaleb completed his BA (2013) and MA (2015) degrees in the Department of Computer Engineering at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). In his Master’s thesis, he studied the aging effect on face recognition utilizing Harry Potter movies. Early academic work experiences include his position as a research assistant in the Smart Interaction, Mobile Intelligence, and Multimedia Technologies (SiMiT) Research Group at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). Furthermore, Ghaleb conducted two internships in the Computer Vision for Human-Computer Interaction (CVHCI) laboratory at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (2014 & 2015).
