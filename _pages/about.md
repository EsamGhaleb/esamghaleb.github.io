Esam Ghaleb is a postdoctoral researcher in the [Dialogue Modelling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/) at the Institute for Logic, Language & Computation (ILLC), University of Amsterdam. Currently, he is working on modeling face-to-face dialogue using NLP, computer vision, and machine learning. His work is embedded within the [Language in Interaction](https://www.languageininteraction.nl/) consortium.

Previously, Ghaleb was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences at Maastricht University, working on the Horizon 2020 project, [ProCare4Life](https://procare4life.eu/). In the ProCare4Life project, his research focused on human behavioral analysis, mainly for people with neurodegenerative diseases. During his postdoctoral research, he worked on XAI for bodily expressed emotion recognition as well. Previously, Ghaleb completed his doctoral research at Maastricht University. During his Ph.D., he carried out research on bimodal emotion recognition through audio-visual cues. His work utilized facial expressions and speech signals in video clips and proposed progressive computational methodologies to capture their complementary information for emotion recognition. Ghaleb’s Ph.D. research was supported by the Horizon 2020 project [MaTHiSiS](http://mathisis-project.eu/). Besides his research and project work, he was a teaching assistant for the computer vision course at DACS at Maastricht University.

Ghaleb has shown passion and enthusiasm for education and research since his childhood. Growing up in a small village in the mountains of Yemen, he moved to the capital, where he completed his high school education in the top 0.2% of students. Subsequently, He was awarded a scholarship to pursue BA (2013) and MA (2015) degrees in the Department of Computer Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. Already as an MA scholar, Ghaleb gained considerable international professional experience by working as a research assistant on an EU project on facial recognition in the wild. He conducted internships at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), publishing the dataset he used for his Master’s thesis (i.e., [ACCIO dataset](https://cvhci.anthropomatik.kit.edu/~zalhalah/papers/icmr_2015_accio.pdf)). Besides, during his MA, he led ITU’s team to win the International Challenge on Biometric Recognition in the Wild 2016.
