Since September 2024, I am a researcher at the [Multimodal Language Department](https://www.mpi.nl/department/multimodal-language-department/23) at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. In this position, I will continue my collaboration with Prof. [Asli Ozyurek](https://www.mpi.nl/people/ozyurek-asli) on multimodal communication and behavior analysis.


**Research Background & Interest.** I am an AI researcher with a background in computer science. My research is driven by my fascination with how people use verbal and nonverbal behaviors in their interactions, from expressing and perceiving emotions to building shared understanding. In my research, I combine insights from cognitive science, psycholinguistics and psychology to computationally model and understand the complexity of human interaction. During my Ph.D. and postdoctoral work at Maastricht University, I made methodological and technical contributions to multimodal modeling of individual behaviors, such as emotions and activities, notably extending explainable AI for emotion recognition to include gestural expressions.Before joining the Multimodal Language Department at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Logic, Language & Computation,  University of Amsterdam. There, I focused on modeling and understanding linguistic and gestural alignment in face-to-face dialogues and the automatic segmentation and representation of co-speech gestures. 

Beside, I have built a strong track record in applied research with societal impact, particularly at the interface of AI and healthcare and e-learning. In these areas, I worked on two EU projects and co-organized pilot studies with over 200 users. Additionally, I led a work package in an EU project that focused on fusing the socio-health expertise of healthcare professionals with machine intelligence. My overarching goal is to integrate verbal and nonverbal behaviors into interactive technologies that prioritize human needs, creating inclusive communication platforms that advance assistive technologies for people with diverse abilities.


**Academic Background.** I am a reseacher with international profile. Born in Yemen, I graduated in the top 0.2% of high school graduates nationwide, securing a competitive full scholarship to pursue my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer engineering at Istanbul Technical University, where I graduated with honors in both programs. I further enriched my international profile during my master’s program with an internship at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. Already as a junior researcher, I published an open-access dataset on age-invariant face recognition using Harry Potter movies. I then pursued my Ph.D. in computer science at Maastricht University, where I developed novel computational methodologies for multimodal emotion recognition.
